          <p class="whotxt">Welcome to The San Fernando Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving mental health access in Ottawa, with a particular emphasis on men's mental health and marginalized groups. Our mission is inspired by the memory of our founder's father, who tragically lost his life to suicide in 2021.</p>
          <p class="whotxt">The foundation is named after San Fernando, Trinidad, where our founder's father was born and raised. This name is a tribute to his deep connection to the culture and music that define the region. It's a reminder that he was more than the pain he endured, and our organization seeks to honor his memory by making mental health resources more accessible to those who need them most.</p>
